# GlowstoneDecompiler
### Version 1.0.0
Welcome to **GlowstoneDecompiler**! This is a **Minecraft modding toolkit** similar to **MCP and MCP-Reborn** and also probably **DecompilerMC**.
**GlowstoneDecompiler** is just bunch of scripts that will run JARs needed to deobfuscate and decompile **Minecraft**.  
**NOTE: GlowstoneDecompiler is not supporting Windows by now, as it only provides Linux BASH scripts.**  
  
GlowstoneDecompiler uses **SpecialSource (BSD-3-Clause licensed)** to deobfuscate Minecraft and it uses **CFR (MIT licensed)** to decompile the deobfuscated jar.

## Future Plans
- Make GlowstoneDecompiler able to deobfuscate and decompile the server jar.
- Add Windows support so users didn't need to use WSL.
- Became a replacement for MCP like other projects.
- I develop this more than playing PvP servers.
