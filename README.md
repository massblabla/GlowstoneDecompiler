# GlowstoneDecompiler
### Version 1.1.0
Welcome to **GlowstoneDecompiler**! This is a **Minecraft modding toolkit** similar to **MCP and MCP-Reborn** and also probably **DecompilerMC**.
**GlowstoneDecompiler** is just bunch of scripts that will run JARs needed to deobfuscate and decompile **Minecraft** using **Mojang's mappings**.  
**NOTE: GlowstoneDecompiler's PowerShell scripts (Microsoft Windows) could still be broken and unusable, I'd recommend using GNU/Linux BASH scripts instead.**  
  
GlowstoneDecompiler uses **SpecialSource (BSD-3-Clause licensed)** to deobfuscate Minecraft and it uses **CFR (MIT licensed)** to decompile the deobfuscated jar.

## Future Plans
- Make GlowstoneDecompiler able to deobfuscate and decompile the server jar.  
- Became a replacement for MCP like other projects.
- I develop this more than playing PvP servers.
- ~~Rebrand GlowstoneDecompiler to Darwin Modding Project~~
