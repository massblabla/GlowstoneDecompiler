# GlowstoneDecompiler
### Version 1.1.0
If you'd love to contribute, please follow these guidelines.  
Almost all things mentioned here are for GitHub.

## Problem Reporting
If you are a user, but then found a problem, you can report it in the Issues tab.  
Please give it details like the log or the screenshot of your terminal, and the clear description of the problem.  
Also you can suggest features, but I think it would be much better if you contribute.

## Contributing
### Guidelines and Knowledege
- If you add a script to GSDC, it's your own code and you have rights to it.
- If you change a tiny bit of code (ie. add a flag to a command, change directory location), you don't have any rights to it.
- I don't recommend to contribute if you don't know how to code, as it could change how it works and make it much worse.
- Please give a clear description to it (don't say it like this for example: bug fixes)
- If there is anything wrong in the [README](README.md) file or this file, you can make an issue with the enhancement label.
- Be respectful.
